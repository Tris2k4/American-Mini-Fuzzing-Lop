In the epsilon greedy strategy, we use a fixed epsilon value to balance exploration and exploitation. The epsilon value is used to determine the probability of selecting a random seed from the seed queue. The epsilon value is set to 0.1, meaning that 10% of the time, a random seed will be selected from the seed queue. The remaining 90% of the time, the seed with the highest coverage will be selected.
